# aws-step-functions

The original version of this camera was created using Node.js.  After some months of successful service the Node.js was replaced by a straight Java port, mainly to look into differences between ease of use and speed.

## Why two Step Functions?

The names of the Node.js and Java Lambda Functions differ, along with the name of the variable used in a decision point in the Step Function.  

## Choose the language your are using for your Lambda Functions
